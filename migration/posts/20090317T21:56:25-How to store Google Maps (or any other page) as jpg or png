I'm using my old Palm TX to navigate during my travels. I don't have GPS, but I usually get some maps from the web, store them as jpg and view on Palm as a picture. 

I had problems to get big maps from Google to jpg, because all screen snapshot programs can only get actual "screen" (usually just 1440x900). 

My palm and other devices can handle much bigger images and it's possible to scroll them. My laptop screen resolution was quite limiting... :-(

I found solution in KDE:
<ol>

	<li>Install Firefox add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3408">Abduction!</a>. It will allow you to save pages or part of the page as image (File -> Save Page As Image...) </li>

	<li>Run Firefox and chose your place in the map.</li>

	<li>Press ALT + F3 -> Advanced -> Special Windows Settings... </li>

	<li>Select Geometry tab and modify "Size" parameters:</li>

</ol>

Then your Firefox should be much bigger (above screen borders) and you should be able to save "one big" page as image...
