		<description><![CDATA[Hi Petrův blog, you has lot of good informations in your blog, I just subscribed on RSS :)
So, can you help me, after the step: make V=99 

Was generated those files:

/opt/openwrt/backfire_10.03.1/bin/ar71xx

kernel-debug.tar.bz2
md5sums
openwrt-ar71xx-rootfs.tar.gz
openwrt-ar71xx-root.jffs2-128k
openwrt-ar71xx-root.jffs2-64k
openwrt-ar71xx-root.squashfs
openwrt-ar71xx-root.squashfs-4k
openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-gzip.bin
openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin
openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.bin
openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.elf
openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.gz
openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.lzma
OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-ar71xx-for-Linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-Linux-x86_64-gcc-4.3.3+cs_uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2
OpenWrt-Toolchain-ar71xx-for-mips_r2-gcc-4.3.3+cs_uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2
packages

But where is: openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

Can I use some of those file to upgrade openwrt?

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am dumbing down your configuration a bit as I am a newbie at this.   I am removing the open wifi stuff for now (although a guest network is a really neat idea that I want to implement later) but can you tell me what is in your /etc/dnsmasq.script?

And thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  Have you thought of putting your config on the openwrt forum or wiki?  It is really good stuff for us learners.

		<description><![CDATA[Great article.  If I implemented your network, dhcp, dns, firewall setup,  what do you think Luci would display in the GUI.  Any chance of it working?

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-381&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@julian &lt;/a&gt; 

Yes you are right. Actually I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;USB Hub&lt;/a&gt; containing 4 ports. To these ports I connected thermometer, USB stick and webcam.

Actually I have no experiences with connecting USB hard drive to to this devices - especially how it is with it&#039;s power source. I&#039;m using USB stick and it&#039;s working fine.

Regards

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article.  Just got my TL-WR1043ND router going with Openwrt latest stable.  Your instructions are useful but I am not so bold to compile just yet.  I am looking to expand the use of mine with external usb hard drive.  I was going through some of your notes.  I am not sure if I understood but it seemed you stated you could put a usb hub off the port and run several devices.  Is that correct.  Also I have an external USB hard drive and I am trying to get the filesystem to mount.  I am still researching but any info you have on this would be helpful.  Unless it doesnt have enough power to drive the external drive or I have to get an external drive that has a case which takes its own power source.  Hope to hear from you as I am still in the research phase of learning about this wonderful router.

Thanks
Julian]]></description>
