Sometimes you have a <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/">RHEL</a>/<a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> server which is not connected to the Internet. But you should also install security update to prevent local hackers to mess up your system.

I was not able to find some nice description how to do it. Some people are using proxies - but then you still need some connection to the proxy - which can not be the case.

Here is my way how I did it....

Let's say there is a server which is offline and doesn't have any connection to the Internet.
Then we need station (or laptop / virtual machine), which has the same OS as server and is connected to the Internet.

Copy the /var/lib/rpm to the station (you can use USB/CD...)
<pre><code class="bash">scp -r /var/lib/rpm root@station:/tmp/
</code></pre> 

Install the download only plugin for yum:
<pre><code class="bash">yum install yum-downloadonly
</code></pre>

Backup the original rpm directory on the station and replace it with the rpm directory from the server:
<pre><code class="bash">mv -v /var/lib/rpm /var/lib/rpm.orig
mv -v /tmp/rpm /var/lib/
</code></pre>

Download updates to /tmp/rpm_updates and return back the /var/lib/rpm
<pre><code class="bash">mkdir -v /tmp/rpm_updates
yum update --downloadonly --downloaddir /tmp/rpm_updates
rm -rvf /var/lib/rpm 
mv -v /var/lib/rpm.orig /var/lib/rpm
</code></pre>

Transfer the downloaded rpms to the server and update:
<pre><code class="bash">scp -r /tmp/rpm_updates root@server:/tmp/
ssh root@server
rpm -Uvh /tmp/rpm_updates/*
</code></pre>

...and the server is updated ;-) 
This is probably not the best way how to do it, but it's working for me.
