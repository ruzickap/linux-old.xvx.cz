My photo collection is stored on the server and accessed by cifs protocol to my notebooks. I'm using <a href="http://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a> to browse my collection in KDE.

This software is storing all thumbnails in ~/.thumbnails/ according <a href="http://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html">http://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html</a> and create <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> database where it stores all information about photos.

<ul>
	<li>The advantage is, that these thumbnails can be also used by other KDE viewers (like <a href="http://gwenview.sourceforge.net/">Gwenview</a>).</li>


	<li>The disadvantage can be that other viewers can generate new thumbnails which are no longer useful an the size of that directory can grow...</li>
</ul>

I decided to write script which can delete all useless thumbnails and keep only the ones used by digiKam. The reason is simple - I don't want remove all thumbnails and regenerate them again only from digiKam, because I have more than 35k photos so it take a long time... 

Here is my digiKam collection configuration:

<img src="http://linux.xvx.cz/wp-uploads/digikam-configure.png" alt="digiKam Configuration" title="digiKam Configuration" width="803" height="367" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-117" />

This script deletes all thumbnails of the photos in <pre><code class="bash">$HOME/.thumbnails/large/</code></pre> which are <strong>not</strong> on network shares :

(It preserves all the thumbnails of photos stored on network share, which take ages to create because of network or which are not changing, and delete all locally ones)
