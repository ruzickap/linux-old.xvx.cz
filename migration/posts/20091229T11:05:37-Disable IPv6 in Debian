I have problem with Java Webstart applications, which are using IPv6 by default. Because I'm not using IPv6 at all I decide to disable this protocol completely.

There are many pages how to disable ipv6 under Debian, but most of them was not working for me.

The most easiest work well: 

Modify <strong><em>/etc/default/grub</em></strong>:

<pre><code class="bash">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1"
</code></pre>

Don't forget to run <em><strong>update-grub</strong></em> after change (and reboot).

Then if you run 

<pre><code class="bash">$ ip a
</code></pre>

you should not see any IPv6 addresses...
