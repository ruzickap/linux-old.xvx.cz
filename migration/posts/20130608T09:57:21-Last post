I decided to move this blog to <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Google's Blogger</a>, because I don't want to run my own server (hardware) any more. The domain will be the same, but all the RRS feeds and pages will have new structure.

The <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> engine is much better than Google's, but there are no free hosting services where you can use your own domain (not to buy one).

I found just these:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>
<li><a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>
<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>
<li><a href="http://www.weebly.com">Weebly</a>
</ul>

I'll do the change in next month or two...

I promise I'll be more active in writing articles on new platform.
Thanks
